### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

For my CMS app, Azure App Service is the better choice. It's cost-effective, scales automatically, and has built-in high availability, making it easier to manage and more reliable than VMs. This way, I can focus more on the app and less on infrastructure.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

If my CMS app needed custom OS configurations or had to run legacy software, Azure VMs would be better. Also, if I expected very high, unpredictable traffic needing manual scaling, VMs would offer flexibility.
